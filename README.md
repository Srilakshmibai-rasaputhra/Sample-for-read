### INTRODUCTION
A person with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may experience lifetime difficulties with language acquisition, communication, cognition, and social skills. It affects around 1% of the world's population and often manifests as developmental problems in the first two years following birth. Although environmental or genetic factors are the primary causes of ASD, early detection and treatment can ameliorate the condition. Currently, the only techniques available for diagnosing ASD are clinical standardized testing. This results in longer diagnosis times as well as a sharp rise in medical expenses. In order to increase the accuracy and time needed for diagnosis. The traditional approaches are being supplemented by machine learning techniques. Based on the results, we built predictive models using models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) with 97.2%, Random Forest Classifier (RFC) with 100%, Na√Øve Bayes (NB) with 97.32%, Logistic Regression (LR) with 100%, and KNN with 96.86%. In order to expedite the diagnostic procedure, our paper's primary goal is to ascertain whether the kid is prone to ASD at an early age. For the dataset we chose, logistic regression has the best accuracy, according to our findings.
